# rock-paper-scissors
u pick a pair number of players and a number and a pair numbers of rounds
the program will choose a player randomly and put it against another random player 
it goes on until the number of that round is impair then :
the program look at each player score and eliminate the lowest one 
how the score is assigned : depends on the number of rounds in general and the number of rounds he in wich he won 
example : if the number of rounds is 5 and the player won in the 3rd round Sig he had 3 win strike of he gets 3 points
if he won is 4 rounds he gets 2 points , if he won in 5 rounds he get 1 point but if he excceded the number of excpected rounds meaning if he won in the 
sixth round or above he gets 0 points 
the score get incremented each game then when the number of players is impaire we eliminate the one with the lowest score

p.s : if u pick a number of players above 22 the program will only show you the final winner due to display inconvenience

the program will display the player who won and its history then the probability of paper rock scissors and draw
it ll give you the posibility to see the history of all players and u can show a specifiq one with its own probability
